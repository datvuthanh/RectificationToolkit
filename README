Epipolar Rectification Toolkit

by Andrea Fusiello, 2018

This toolkit is a collection of Matlab function implementing
epipolar rectification both in the calibrated and uncalibrated case.
It requires some functions contained in the Computer Vision Toolkit
(http://www.diegm.uniud.it/fusiello/sw/ComputerVisionToolkit.zip)
by the same author and the VLfeat toolbox (http://www.vlfeat.org) 
by A. Vedaldi, for the SIFT implementation.

After installing the abovementioned dependencies, cd to the toolkit 
main directory and type runMe. This will call the calibrated rectification 
and the uncalibrated one, in a sequence. 

The data is in the "examples" folder. It should be easy to replace it 
with your own images. The 3x4 camera matrix, or PPM, is contained in a  
text file with extension ".pm".

While in the calibrated case results are always guaranteed, provided 
the PPMs are correct, in the uncalibrated case they depend on the matches 
computed by RANSAC and on the sucess of a non-linear minimization, 
so they are data-dependent.
